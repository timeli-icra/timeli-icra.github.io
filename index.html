<h1>Time-Aware Assistive Navigation</h1>
  Can interactive vision-and-language agents learn not just what to say but also when to say it? 
Current language models rarely plan over whether and when to realize a real-time response to a user. However, providing accurate and timely support for human decision-making, such as when guiding visually impaired individuals through urban environments, requires careful real-time responsiveness--poorly timed responses can distract users or add unnecessary cognitive load.
As a machine intelligence challenge for Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based agents, we introduce a large-scale multimodal benchmark for an egocentric, assistive navigation task in complex outdoor environments. Using this benchmark, we uncover a fundamental limitation of off-the-shelf MLLMs in delivering safe and time-sensitive navigation instructions, even with model fine-tuning on substantial amounts of data. We then demonstrate that a simple yet effective modification of the model, including direct supervision to predict the underlying reason for each instruction, yields significant performance gains across open-loop, closed-loop, and sim-to-real generalization settings.
